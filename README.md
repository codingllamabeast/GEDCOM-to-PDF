GEDCOM to PDF is a python desktop conversion application that takes a GEDCOM file (family tree data) and outputs it as a pdf. It outputs contents of the 
GEDCOM in a format that is easily readable by a person, providing a list of ancestors of each generation starting with generation 1 (you). It lists each
member of the tree, birth date, birth place, marriage date, death date, death place, and most importantly, sources, all in one organized chunk per member
on the pedigree.
